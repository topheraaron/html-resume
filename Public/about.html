<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a web & graphic design background specializing in visual design. I'm passionate about creating usable digital products that connects others through human experiences.</p>

<p>I collaborate with clients, teams and talented individuals to solve everyday creative challenges and help them achieve goals, reach targets and make better business decisions through great design.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I like to spend time at the gym or going on a hike. Catching some sun at the beach and taking in the beauty of the scenery around me. I love traveling which always is a huge source of inspiration for me.</p>
